                        <p>After much discussion regarding the places and suitable dates to travel, team GeekyBones finally agreed on a two day trip to Hail Himalayas near Solan.

                        <p>Finally, on Saturday at 7:00 AM, team GeekyBones excitedly boarded the private bus, beginning the journeys with joy and fun. While dancing, playing antakshari and cards and relaxing, we all entered Himachal. </p>
<p> We all felt like a paradise surrounded by greenery, where the rays of the sun were falling on the mountains. The scene was so mesmerizing and reliving that it was captured in our cameras and our memories forever. </p>
<p> Around 11 oâ€™clock, we stopped at the restaurant near the fascinating view of the mountains to have our breakfast. And then we again started moving towards our destination, and our craziness was on peak. Finally, after 4 hours of travelling, we reached our destination at 11:30 AM. The rooms were allotted, and after lunch, we took a 1-hour rest. </p>

                        <p>We all at GeekyBones were thrilled to get started with the activities that included rope walk, zip line, tire walk, ring walk, Burma bridge, balancing, Tarzan swing & commando net, etc. After our activities, we enjoyed our evening snacks. In the late evening, we rocked with a bonfire and DJ party where we all danced and enjoyed the moments. Then, after a delicious dinner, we all went to our rooms, where we played cards, gossiped and went to sleep.</p>
